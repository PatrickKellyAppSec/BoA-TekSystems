#Task 3:
#Part 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (40 points)
#Objective: Assess the candidate's familiarity with configuration management tools and CI/CD pipeline integration.
#Scenario: Your organization uses Jenkins or GitHub to manage their CI/CD pipelines. You are tasked with setting up a new pipeline for a cloud-native #application.
#
1. Configuration Management with Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Terraform (15 points):
o Choose one configuration management tool (Ansible, Chef, or Puppet, terraform). o Write a script/playbook to automate the deployment of a web server on a virtual
machine.
2. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (25 points):
o Create a Jenkins pipeline configuration (Jenkinsfile) that includes stages for building,
testing, and deploying a sample application to Azure.
o Ensure that the pipeline includes security scanning as a step.
OR
3. GitHub Actions for AWS (25 points):
o Write a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys a serverless application to AWS
Lambda.
o Include steps for linting, testing, and deployment.
For Part 3, you only need to choose ONE pipeline in either Jenkins or Github, you donâ€™t need to do both.
# * I wanted to do both...it was fun
